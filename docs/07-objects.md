# Objects: `objects.rlb`, unit assemblies, and object meshes

Three small formats that together turn a name in a mission file into geometry.

```
mission data.tma  "s_tree_06"                    (scenery)
  -> objects.rlb  STAT record
     -> static.rlb  s_tree_0_06.msh   geometry
     -> static.rlb  s_tree_0_06.wea   texture names

mission data.tma  "UNITS\BUILDS\GENER\gener01.dat"   (building or unit)
  -> the .dat assembly, a list of components
     -> objects.rlb  FORT/INTO/EXTO/... record per component
        -> fortif.rlb / intsys.rlb / turrets.rlb / ...
```

## objects.rlb — resource reference records

590 records. Each is a run of **64-byte slots**, each slot a
`(archive, member)` pair in two 32-byte NUL-padded fields. The NRes tag says
what kind of thing the record describes:

| Tag | Size | Slots | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STAT` | 384 | 6 | 81 | scenery — `.msh` `.wea` `.cpt` `.ndp` `.ctl` |
| `INTO` | 320 | 5 | 192 | internal part (engines, armour, batteries) |
| `EXTO` | 320 | 5 | 146 | external part (turrets) |
| `BULL` | 320 | 5 | 67 | projectile |
| `BTLU` | 320/448 | 5/7 | 63 | creature |
| `FORT` | 128 | 2 | 34 | fortification / building |
| `WPNS` | 320 | 5 | 5 | weapon |
| `SUNO` | 128 | 2 | 2 | sun |

A scenery record reads:

```
slot 0  static.rlb  s_tree_0_06.msh
slot 1  static.rlb  s_tree_0_06.wea
slot 2  static.rlb  s_tree_0_06.cpt
slot 3  static.rlb  s_tree_0_06.ndp
slot 4  static.rlb  s_tree_a_06.ctl
slot 5  -           -
```

All 405 populated slots across the 81 `STAT` records resolve to real archive
members.

## UNITS/**/*.dat — unit and building assemblies

458 files, all the same shape:

```
uint32   magic, always 0x0000F0F1
uint32   class word
components × N, 112 bytes each:
    char[32]  archive name, always "objects.rlb"
    char[32]  record name
    uint32    varies
    int32     varies
    char[32]  display name
    uint32    varies
    int32     varies
```

**A unit is an assembly of parts**, which is the game's central mechanic
written straight into the data. `UNITS/UNITS/BATTLE/w_b_trk1.dat` is 18
components:

```
R_B_04       Large Track Chs (L-42t)
i_arm_b_02   ARMOUR LA.Mk3 (ARM 3)
i_eng_b_03   Large engine (LEng4)
i_pws_b_03   Large Battery (LBt4)
i_fsh_b_df   Lrg Shld generator (LSG1)
i_dsh_b_df   Large detect.shld (LDS1)
...
```

The display names are the strings the game's UI shows, so the whole parts
catalogue is readable without touching the executable.

All 458 files parse on the 112-byte stride, giving 5708 components. **5705
resolve** in `objects.rlb`; three do not — `fr_l_mast`, `fr_l_tele` and
`u_tel_def_a_03` — which look like content cut before release.

## MESH — object geometry

An object mesh is **an NRes archive nested inside an archive member**, using
the same numeric-type-as-stream-selector convention as the terrain and the
same per-vertex encodings. All 68 meshes in `static.rlb` carry the same 14
streams:

| Stream | Stride | Indexed by | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 12 | vertex | position, `float32` x/y/z, **Z up** |
| 4 | 4 | vertex | normal, `int8` x/y/z ÷ 127, plus a padding byte |
| 5 | 4 | vertex | UV, `uint16` 8.8 fixed point |
| 6 | 6 | face | triangle, three `uint16` vertex indices |
| 9 | 32 | sub-object | sub-object name |
| 1 | 38 | sub-object | header, unresolved |
| 7 | 16 | face | face record, unresolved |
| 10 | 4 | sub-object | one `uint32`, zero throughout |
| 2, 8, 13, 15 | — | — | unresolved |
| 17, 19 | 0 | — | always empty |

Streams 4 and 5 use exactly the encodings established for the terrain, which
is a useful independent confirmation of both: the normals come out unit-length
to within 0.013 across all 68 meshes.

Sub-object names describe the model's construction: `s_tree_0_06` is
`Base_TM`, `leaf1_m1o1`, `leaf2_m1o1`, `leaf3_m1o1`.

### Vegetation is billboards

Rendering the decoded geometry untextured makes rocks look like rocks, but
trees look like sparse skeletons — because that is what they are. `s_tree_33`
is 24 vertices and **12 triangles**: a pair of crossed planes. `s_tree_05` has
ten sub-objects named `lf11_m1o1` through `lf33_m1o1` — leaf clusters. The
foliage is alpha-textured planes, so it needs the texture assignment to read
correctly.

### Which texture a face uses is not known

Each mesh has a `.wea` naming 2–4 textures, but nothing found so far selects
between them per face. Face record field 0 is zero on every face of every
mesh, and no other field has a range matching the texture count. The
sub-object count sometimes equals the texture count (`s_tree_0_06`: 4 and 4)
and sometimes does not (`s_stn_0_10`: 1 and 2). See
[06-open-questions.md](06-open-questions.md).

## Local origins

Object meshes are not consistently based at z = 0. `s_tree_0_06` spans
z −11.1 to +22.8; `s_tree_59` spans −127.1 to +2.1, almost entirely *below*
its origin — and the missions place it 125 units above the ground, which
compensates almost exactly. Adding the mesh's minimum z to its placement does
not make scenery sit flush in general (median −1.9, wide spread), so there is
probably a transform in the `.ctl` controller that has not been read yet.
Buildings, by contrast, sit at a median of +0.000 above the terrain.
